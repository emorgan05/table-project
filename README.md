# Table Project

> A Vue.js project

## Build Setup

To Run:
``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

## TODO
1. Unit tests -- particularly around the functions for the checkboxes
2. More reusable special formatting for certain columns
3. Because downloading is limited to only rows with status 'available', disable the other checkboxes to make it clear they can not be downloaded
4. Make sure checkboxes are accessible
